### Guidelines for ANGULAR

#### NGRX

- Use the createFeature and createReducer functions to simplify reducer creation
- Implement the facade pattern to abstract NgRx implementation details from components
- Use entity adapter for collections to standardize CRUD operations
- Leverage selectors with memoization to efficiently derive state and prevent unnecessary calculations
- Implement @ngrx/effects for handling side effects like API calls
- Use action creators with typed payloads to ensure type safety throughout the application
- Implement @ngrx/component-store for local state management in complex components
- Use @ngrx/router-store to connect the router to the store
- Leverage @ngrx/entity-data for simplified entity management
- Implement the concatLatestFrom operator for effects that need state with actions
